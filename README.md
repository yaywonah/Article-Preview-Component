## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned more about the position property, and I also tried using more custom CSS properties. I had some trouble on figuring out how to make the share class cover the end of the container without leaving space on the bottom, but I tried solving it using the margin property.

### Useful resources
